## Future Features 

###  Map feature 

We would like to add a map either onto the home page or as a separate page which adds the location each post is tagged to as a pin.
You would then be able to navigate around the map and select a post based on its location.

### Add own image to post

Currently a random image will be chosen and generated for the posts. 
Would like to implement the ability for post creators to upload their own image with their post

### Deselect emoji 

Would have liked to give the option to deselect an emoji.
Also not being able to select the dislike emoji when the like emoji has been selected would be a good feature.

### Homepage filters

Being able to filter the homepage by different criteria such as:
- Date
- Emoji count
- Labels
